% Answer program related questions with executable code (executable from within the Mozart UI) 

% Note: While many of these questions are based on questions from the book, there are some
% differences; namely, extensions and clarifications. 

/* Question 1: Rewrite the function SumList, and the function ScanL, 
where the state is stored in a memory cell when the function is called, 
and a helper function performs the recursive algorithm. */

/* Question 4: Rewrite the functional stream that generates the numbers
starting form 0 then adding one up to infinity, (0 1 2 3 …),
